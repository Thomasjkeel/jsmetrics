.. Built from sub-components
.. ----------------------------
.. All statistics and algorithms in this package are built ontop of various one-purpose functions which we refer to as 'sub-components'. 
.. These sub-component functions should have one role (e.g. to calculate atmospheric mass at a given atmospheric level), and should allow yet to be added metrics an easier implementation.
