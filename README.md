# jet-stream-metrics

To-Do:
- way of dealing with data from different sources
- argparse to parse a list for additional arguments i.e. return_coord_error (do more user testing)
- Improve readme(s) and add links (DOI?)
- add lat and lon subsetting to jetstream_metrics_dict
- look into bash arrays and running multiple metrics
- add test that profiles the speed of each metric based on standard sizes of the dataset (then makes a estimation for how long it would take to run a lot of data)
