To-Do:
- way of dealing with data from different sources
- argparse to parse a list for additional arguments i.e. return_coord_error
- Readme and links (DOI?)
- Refactor code to include new swap_coord function (which will put all the lower numbers first and will be found performed default by dataformatter)
