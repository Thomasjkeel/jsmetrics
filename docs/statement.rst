What are jet-streams?
---------------------
Jet streams are features of the atmospheric circulation that manifest as fast-flowing ribbons of air, usually around
8-12 km above the surface. 
They form in regions of extreme temperature gradients

They is no exact definition for what is and not a 'jet-stream' at any scale, as such differences in their measurement. 



.. Built from sub-components
.. ----------------------------
.. All statistics and algorithms in this package are built ontop of various one-purpose functions which we refer to as 'sub-components'. 
.. These sub-component functions should have one role (e.g. to calculate atmospheric mass at a given atmospheric level), and should allow yet to be added metrics an easier implementation.
